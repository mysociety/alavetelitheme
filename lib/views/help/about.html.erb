  AskYourGov.ug has been built to help members of the public get the information they want about from Uganda public authorities â€“ by asking for it.
  It will also make life easier for Ugandan public officials because they will be less likely to have to answer repeated requests about the same subject: 
  once a question has been answered everyone will be able to find the information stored on this website.
