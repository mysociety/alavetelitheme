    <dd><p>We will not disclose your email address to anyone unless we are obliged to by law,
        or you ask us to. This includes the public authority that you are sending a
        request to.  They only get to see an email address
        @<%= AlaveteliConfiguration::incoming_email_domain %> which is specific to that request.  </p>
      <p>If you send a message to another user on the site, then it will reveal your

    <dt id="nasty_spam">Will you send nasty, brutish spam to my email address? <a href="#nasty_spam">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>Nope. After you sign up to <%= site_name %> we will only send you emails
      relating to a request you made, an email alert that you have signed up for,
      or for other reasons that you specifically authorise. We will never give or
      sell your email addresses to anyone else, unless we are obliged to by law, or
      you ask us to.

    <dt id="public_request">Why will my name and my request appear publicly on the site? <a href="#public_request">#</a> </dt>

    <dd>
      <p>We publish your request on the Internet so that anybody can read it and
        make use of the information that you have found. We do not normally delete
        requests (<a href="#delete_requests">more details</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Your name is tangled up with your request, so has to be published as well.
        It is only fair, as we're going to publish the name of the civil servant who
        writes the response to your request.  Using your real name also helps people
        get in touch with you to assist you with your research or to campaign with you.
      </p>
      <p>By law, you must use your real name for the request to be a valid Freedom of
        Information request. See the next question for alternatives if you do not want
        to publish your full name.

    <dt id="real_name">Can I make an OPRA request using a pseudonym? <a href="#real_name">#</a> </dt>


    <dd>
      <p>Yes, you can make requests anonymously under OPRA, however the law specifically forbids anonymous requests for records of victims of crime.
        <a href="http://www.nj.gov/grc/custodians/faqs/#4">guidance from the Government Records Council.</a>
      </p>

      <p>Be careful though, even if the authority follows this good practice, the
        pseudonym will probably make it impossible for you to complain to the GRC or courts
        later about the handling of your request.
      </p>

      <p>There are several good alternatives to using a pseudonym.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Use a different form of your name. The guidance says
          that "Mr Arthur Thomas Roberts" can make a valid request as "Arthur Roberts",
          "A. T. Roberts", or "Mr Roberts", but <strong>not</strong> as "Arthur" or "A.T.R.".
        </li>
        <li>Women may use their maiden name.</li>
        <li>In most cases, you may use any name by which you are "widely known and/or
          is regularly used".</li>
        <li>Use the name of an organisation, the name of a company, the trading name of
            a company, or the trading name of a sole trader.</li>
        <li>Ask someone else to make the request on your behalf.</li>
        <li>You may, if you are really stuck, ask us to make the request on
          your behalf. Please <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">contact us</a> with
          a good reason why you cannot make the request yourself and cannot
          ask a friend to. We don't have the resources to do this for everyone.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Please do not try to impersonate someone else.</p>

    </dd>

    <dt id="full_address">They've asked for my postal address! <a href="#full_address">#</a> </dt>

    <dd>
      <p>If a public authority asks you for your full, physical address, reply to them saying
        that an email address should be all that's required under OPRA since you requested <thead>
        public records electronically.
        </thead>
      </p>

    </dd>

    <dt id="postal_answer">No no, they need a postal address to send a paper response! <a href="#postal_answer">#</a> </dt>

    <dd>
      <p>If an authority only has a paper copy of the information that you want,
        they may ask you for a postal address. To start with, try persuading them
        to scan in the documents for you. You can even <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/car_parking_charges_policy_and_a#outgoing-532">offer to gift them a scanner</a>, which in that particular case
        embarrassed the authority into finding one they had already.</p>

      <p>If that doesn't work, and you want to provide your postal address privately
        in order to receive the documents, mark your request as "They are going to reply by post", and it will
        give you an email address to use for that purpose.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="delete_requests">Can you delete my requests, or alter my name?  <a href="#delete_requests">#</a> </dt>

    <dd>

      <p><%= site_name %> is a permanent, public archive of Open Public Records Act requests. Even though you may not find the response to
        a request useful any more, it may be of interest to others. For this
        reason, we will not delete requests.
      </p>

      <p>Under exceptional circumstances we may remove or change your name
        on the website, <a href="#takedown">see the next question</a>.
        Similarly, we may also remove other personal information.
      </p>

      <p>If you're worried about this before you make your request,
        see the section on <a href="#real_name">pseudonyms</a>.</p>

    </dd>

    <dt id="takedown">Can you take down personal information about me? <a href="#takedown">#</a> </dt>

    <dd>

      <p>If you see any personal information about you on the site which you'd like
        us to remove or hide, then please <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">let us know</a>.
        Specify exactly what information you believe to be problematic and why, and
        where it appears on the site.</p>

      <p>If it is sensitive personal information that has been accidentally
        posted, then we will usually remove it. Normally we will only consider
        requests to remove personal information which come from the individual
        concerned, but for sensitive information we would appreciate anyone
        pointing out anything they see.</p>

      <p>We consider that there is a strong public interest in
        retaining the names of officers or servants of public authorities. We will only
        remove such names in exceptional circumstances, such as where the disclosure of
        a name and position of employment would substantially risk an individual's
        safety. If you are such an official and you wish to have your name removed for
        such an urgent reason, you must supply us with a request to do so from your
        line manager. This request must demonstrate that a risk has been perceived
        which outweighs the public interest, and must demonstrate that efforts have
        been made to conceal the name on the organisation's own website.</p>

      <p>For all other requests we apply a public interest test to decide
        whether information should be removed.</p>
