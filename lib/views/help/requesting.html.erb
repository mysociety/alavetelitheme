      <p>It can be hard to untangle government's complicated structure, and work out
        who holds the information that you want. Here are a few tips:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Browse or search <%= site_name %> looking for similar requests to yours.</li>
        <li>When you've found an authority you think might have the information, use
          the "home page" link on the right hand side of their page to check what they do
          on their website.</li>
        <li>Contact the authority by phone or email to ask if they hold the kind of
          information you're after.</li>
        <li>Don't worry excessively about getting the right authority. If you get it
          wrong, they ought to advise you who to make the request to instead.
        </li>
        <li>If you've got a thorny case, please <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">contact us</a> for help.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Please <a href="<%= new_change_request_path %>">contact us</a> with the name of the public authority and,
        if you can find it, their contact email address for Freedom of Information requests.

      <p>
        Please put in your request only what is needed so that someone can
        easily identify what information you are asking for. Please do
        <i>not</i> include any of the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>arguments about your cause</li>
        <li>statements that could defame or insult others</li>

        If you want information to support an argument or campaign, Freedom of
        Information is a powerful tool. Although you may not use this site to
        run your campaign, we encourage you to use it to get the information you
        need. We also encourage to run your campaign elsewhere - one effective
        and very easy way is to <%= link_to 'start your own blog',
          "http://wordpress.com/"%>.
        <% if AlaveteliConfiguration::enable_annotations %>
          You are welcome to link to your campaign from this site in an
          annotation to your request (you can make annotations after submitting
          the request).

    <dt id="fees">Does it cost me anything to make a request?<a href="#fees">#</a> </dt>

    <dd>

      <p>Making an OPRA request is nearly always free.</p>

      <p>Authorities often include unnecessary, scary, boilerplate in
        acknowledgement messages saying they "may" charge a fee. Ignore such notices.
        They hardly ever will actually charge a fee.  If they do, they can only charge you if
        you have specifically agreed in advance to pay.  <a
        href="http://www.nj.gov/grc/pdf/OPRASpecialServiceCharge.pdf">More
        details</a> from the GRC about when fees can be charged.

    <dt id="quickly_response">How quickly will I get a response? <a href="#quickly_response">#</a> </dt>

    <dd>
      <p>By law, public authorities must respond <strong>within 7 business days</strong> to
        requests.
      </p>

      <p>Even if they are not prompt, in nearly all cases they must respond within
        7 business days or request an extension. If you had to clarify your request, or they are a school,
        or one or two other cases, then they may have more time
        (<a href="<%= help_officers_path(:anchor => 'days') %>">full details</a>).
      </p>
      <p><%= site_name %> will email you if you don't get a timely response.  You can
        then send the public authority a message to remind them, and tell them if they
        are breaking the law.</p>

    </dd>

    <dt id="no_response">What if I never get a response?<a href="#no_response">#</a> </dt>

    <dd>
      <p>There are several things you can do if you never get a response.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sometimes there has been a genuine problem and the authority never
          received the request. It is worth telephoning the authority and politely
          checking that they received the request. It was sent to them by email.
        </li>
        <li>If they have not received it, the problem is most likely due to
          "spam filters". Refer the authority to the measures in the answer
          '<a href="<%= help_officers_path(:anchor => 'spam_problems') %>">I can see a request on <%= site_name %>, but we never got it by email!</a>'
          in the OPRA custodians section of this help.
        </li>
        <li>If you're still having no luck, then you can ask for an internal review,
          and then complain to the Information Commissioner about the authority.
          Read our page '<a href="<%= help_general_path(:action => 'unhappy') %>">Unhappy about the response you got?</a>'.

    </dd>

    <dt id="ico_help">Can you tell me more of the nitty gritty about the process of making requests? <a href="#ico_help">#</a> </dt>

      <p>No. Requests made using <%= site_name %> are public, made under the Open Public
        Records Act, and cannot help you find information about a private
        individual.</p>

      <p>If you see that somebody has included personal information, perhaps
        unwittingly, in a request, please <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">contact us</a>

    <dd><p><%= site_name %> is currently only designed for public requests. All
        responses that we receive are automatically published on the website for anyone
        to read.  </p>
      <p>You should contact the public authority directly if you would like to
        make a request in private.  If you're interested in buying a system which helps
        you manage OPRA requests in secret, then <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">contact us</a>.

    </dd>

    <dt id="multiple">Can I make the same to request to lots of authorities, e.g. all councils? <a href="#multiple">#</a> </dt>

    <dd>We ask you to first send a test version of your request to a few
      authorities. Their responses will help you improve the wording of your request,
      so that you get the best information when you send the request to all of
      the authorities. There is currently no automated system for sending the request
      to the other authorities, you must copy and paste it by hand.

    <dd><%= site_name %> is an archive of requests made through the site,
      and does not try to be an archive of all OPRA requests. We'll never support uploading
      other requests. For one thing, we wouldn't be able to verify that other
      responses actually came from the authority. If this really matters to you,
